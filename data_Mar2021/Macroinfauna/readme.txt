AMBON15_env.csv			simplified version of 'AMBON15_MasterStationFAM.xlsx, with single header row
				Removed 'nd' in delC13 column and 'no grabs' in abundance column
				Changed station names to use only first name (not alternate)
				First row (general info) removed
				I added del O18 values based on spreadsheets sent by Lee Cooper (April 2021) to
					compute fraction of sea ice melt and runoff fraction (see folder O18)
AMBON17_env.csv			simplified version of 'AMBON15_MasterStationFAM.xlsx, with single header row
				I removed some notes (text) in several columns
				I changed station names to use only first name (not alternate)
				deleted station 'CEO 16' (should be CEO16 - little data, no bio data)
				changed several lower case 'a' in station names to upper case 'A' (e.g. ML3.7A)
				I added del O18 values based on spreadsheets sent by Lee Cooper (April 2021) to
					compute fraction of sea ice melt and runoff fraction (see folder O18)
