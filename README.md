## Analysis of eight assemblages from microbes to seabirds in the Northeast Chukchi Sea. 
The analysis focuses on difference in diversity and species composition, as well as relationships of diversity and community composition to oceanographic and habitat conditions, between 2015 and 2017. These years were characterized by contrasting environmental conditions with warmer conditions and a stronger influx of Pacific waters into the Chukchi Sea in 2017. 

For details of the analysis, results and interpretation, see:
Mueter, F.J., Iken, K., Cooper, L.W., Grebmeier, J.M., Kuletz, K.J., Hopcroft, R.R., Danielson, S.L., Collins, R.E., Cushing, D. Changes in diversity and species composition across multiple assemblages in the northeast Chukchi Sea during two contrasting years are consistent with borealization. Oceanography (In Press).
